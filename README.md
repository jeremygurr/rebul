# Rebul : Reduced Complexity Build Scripts

Intended as a replacement for ant, mvn, gradle to build / test / package / run source based projects. 

It pushes convention over configuration to the point that there are no traditional configuration files for a project. 

This project is based on the simpleton script framework.
